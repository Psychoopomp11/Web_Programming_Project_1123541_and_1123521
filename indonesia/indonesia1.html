        <h2>1. Komodo Dragon</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Varanus komodoensis</div>
        <img src="../indonesia/indonesia animal img/1200px-Komodo_dragon_(Varanus_komodoensis).jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Komodo Dragon</b> is one of the most iconic and awe-inspiring creatures on the planet. Native to the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and a few others, this giant lizard is the largest living species of lizard in the world. It can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet) long and weigh as much as 150 kilograms (330 pounds). With their large, muscular bodies, long tails, and sharp claws, Komodo Dragons are true predators of their environment. Their skin is tough and scaly, colored in shades of brown, gray, and orange, allowing them to blend into the rocky landscapes of their island homes.</p>
        <p><b>Komodo Dragons</b> are carnivores, meaning they eat meat. They hunt and ambush prey, including large animals like deer, wild boar, and even water buffalo. One of their most fascinating features is their powerful bite. While their teeth are sharp and serrated, itâ€™s actually the bacteria in their mouths that contribute to their hunting technique. When a Komodo Dragon bites its prey, it often causes a severe infection, and the animal may die from blood poisoning a few days later. These dragons are also opportunistic scavengers, and they will eat the carcasses of dead animals if they come across them.</p>
        <p>The <b>Komodo Dragon</b> has few natural predators, but it faces a significant threat from habitat destruction and human activity. The introduction of non-native species and the effects of climate change are also major concerns. Efforts are being made to conserve these incredible reptiles, including the establishment of protected areas like Komodo National Park.</p>

        <p> <b>Fun Fact:</b>  Despite their fierce reputation, Komodo Dragons are surprisingly slow-moving, only reaching speeds of about 20 kilometers per hour (12 miles per hour) in short bursts!</p>

        <h2>2. Anoa </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Bubalus sp.</div>
        <img src="../indonesia/indonesia animal img/anoa.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Anoa</b>, also known as the Dwarf Buffalo, is a rare and elusive species native to the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and Buton. These small, forest-dwelling buffaloes are characterized by their short, compact bodies and relatively small size compared to other buffalo species. Anoa typically grows to about 1 meter (3.3 feet) at the shoulder, and they weigh between 300 to 600 kilograms (660 to 1,320 pounds). Their dark brown to black fur, along with their curved horns, makes them easily recognizable.</p>
        <p>Anoas are herbivores, feeding on a variety of vegetation, including grasses, fruits, and leaves. They are known for their solitary behavior, often wandering alone or in pairs through dense forests. Though not aggressive, they can be territorial and are very cautious of humans. The Anoa is a nocturnal animal, and much of its activity is centered around foraging for food in the cover of night.</p>
        <p>The <b>Anoa</b> is critically endangered, with habitat loss and hunting being the primary threats to its survival. As these animals are rarely seen in the wild, they are not well understood, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect their dwindling populations.</p>

        <div class="taxonomy">Rhinoceros sondaicus</div>
        <img src="../indonesia/indonesia animal img/badak jawa.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Javan Rhino</b>, or Badak Jawa, is one of the rarest rhino species in the world. Found only on the island of Java in Indonesia, the Javan Rhino is a critically endangered species with fewer than 75 individuals remaining in the wild. These rhinos are smaller than their African counterparts, measuring between 3 to 4 meters (9.8 to 13 feet) in length and weighing between 900 to 2,300 kilograms (1,980 to 5,070 pounds).</p>
        <p>Javan Rhinos have thick, gray skin that folds in deep creases, with a single horn located on their snout. They are solitary animals, typically found in dense tropical forests or wetlands, where they feed on a variety of vegetation, including grasses, leaves, and fruits. Despite their size and strength, Javan Rhinos are generally shy and avoid contact with humans.</p>
        <p>Conservation efforts for the Javan Rhino focus on protecting their remaining habitat in Ujung Kulon National Park and combating poaching. As of now, the Javan Rhino is critically endangered, with only a small population surviving in a single, isolated area.</p>

        <div class="taxonomy">Nisaetus floris</div>
        <img src="../indonesia/indonesia animal img/elang flores.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Flores Hawk-Eagle</b> is a striking bird of prey found only on the island of Flores in Indonesia. This bird is known for its incredible hunting ability and its impressive physical appearance, which includes a strikingly dark plumage with a white underside. With a wingspan of up to 2 meters (6.5 feet), the Flores Hawk-Eagle is a formidable predator in the forests it inhabits.</p>
        <p>These eagles primarily hunt small mammals, birds, and reptiles, using their sharp talons and strong beaks to capture and kill prey. They are solitary creatures, typically nesting in tall trees, where they have a clear view of the surrounding area. The Flores Hawk-Eagle is also a symbol of the region's wildlife conservation efforts, as it is critically endangered due to habitat loss and illegal hunting.</p>
        <p>Efforts are being made to protect the species by conserving its natural habitat in the forests of Flores and implementing anti-poaching regulations.</p>
