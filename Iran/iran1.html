        <!--  Baluchistan Black Bear -->
        <h2>1. Baluchistan Black Bear</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Ursus thibetanus gedrosianus</div>
        <img src="../Iran/iran animal img/Baluchistan Black Bear.jpg" >
        <p><b>Baluchistan Black Bear</b>, also known as the Balochistan Black Bear, is a unique subspecies of the Asiatic Black Bear. These bears are smaller than their relatives, with a head and body length of about 1.2 to 1.5 meters (4 to 5 feet), and they have short, coarse fur that ranges from black to reddish-brown. Their distinctive appearance includes a white or cream-colored chest mark, which is often crescent-shaped.</p>

        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Baluchistan Black Bears are found in the hilly regions of the Balochistan province in southwest Pakistan and parts of Iran. They inhabit temperate and tropical woodlands in hilly or mountainous areas with heavy brush cover. Their greatest stronghold is the hills south of Khuzdar. They have also been recorded in Takht-e-Sulaiman, Toba Kakar Range, Ziarat, and Kalat District.</p>

        <p><b>Diet and Behavior:</b> These bears are omnivorous, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Their diet consists of fruits, nuts, buds, insects, and small reptiles. They are excellent climbers and swimmers, using these skills to find food and navigate their environment. They are mainly active at night and spend much of the day sleeping.</p>

        <p><b>Conservation Status:</b> The Baluchistan Black Bear is considered Critically Endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and reduce human-bear conflicts.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Despite their name, Baluchistan Black Bears are more frugivorous than other subspecies, and they love to eat figs and bananas.</p>

        <p><b>Siberian Crane</b>, also known as the Siberian White Crane or Snow Crane, is a large, elegant bird native to the Arctic tundra of Russia. These cranes are distinctive among other cranes due to their nearly all-white plumage, except for their black primary feathers that are visible in flight.</p>

        <p><b>Habitat and Migration:</b> Siberian Cranes breed in the Arctic tundra of western and eastern Russia. They migrate to wintering grounds in China, India, and Iran. During migration, they travel in large flocks, covering thousands of kilometers. They are typically found around lake edges and fields, where they forage in small to medium-sized groups, primarily for plant matter and invertebrates.</p>

        <p><b>Diet and Behavior:</b> These cranes are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter and invertebrates. They are known for their graceful movements and elaborate courtship dances, which are an important part of their mating rituals.</p>

        <p><b>Conservation Status:</b> The Siberian Crane is listed as a Critically Endangered species due to habitat loss, hunting, and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and ensure their survival.</p>

        <img src="../Iran/iran animal img/asiatic cheetah.avif" >
        <p><b>Asiatic Cheetah</b> is a rare and elegant feline, once widespread across Asia but now critically endangered and found only in Iran. These cheetahs have a lean body, long legs, and a distinctive spotted coat that helps them camouflage in their arid desert habitat. They are slightly smaller than their African counterparts but equally swift, capable of reaching speeds up to 112 km/h (70 mph) for short bursts while chasing prey.</p>

        <p><b>Diet and Behavior:</b> Asiatic Cheetahs primarily hunt small to medium-sized animals like gazelles and hares, using their incredible speed and stealth to surprise their prey. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their habitat and prey species, as well as raising awareness to reduce human-wildlife conflicts.</p>

        <p><b>Conservation Status:</b> The Asiatic Cheetah is listed as Critically Endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflicts. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and raise awareness.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Asiatic Cheetahs are nicknamed the "Ghosts of the Desert" because of their elusive nature and ability to vanish into the landscape!</p>

        <img src="../Iran/iran animal img/caspian seal.jpg" >
        <p><b>Caspian Seal</b> is a small, adorable marine mammal native to the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest enclosed body of water. These seals have a grayish coat with dark spots and are well adapted to life in both icy and warm waters. Caspian Seals are excellent swimmers, using their flippers to navigate and their streamlined bodies to dive deep in search of fish and crustaceans.</p>

        <p><b>Conservation Status:</b> Unfortunately, they are an endangered species, threatened by pollution, habitat degradation, and overfishing in the Caspian Sea. Conservationists are working to monitor their population and reduce human impacts on their environment.</p>
