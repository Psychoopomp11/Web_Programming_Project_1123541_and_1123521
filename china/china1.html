        <h2>1. Golden Snub-Nosed Monkey</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Rhinopithecus roxellana</div>
        <img src="../china/china animal img/golden snub nosed monkeys.avif" >
        <p>The <b>Golden Snub-Nosed Monkey</b> is a real treasure of China’s misty mountains. With its dazzling golden fur and unique, upturned nose, this monkey looks like it belongs in a fairy tale. These clever creatures live in cold, high-altitude forests, where they huddle together in groups to stay warm. Families stick close to each other, and it’s not unusual to see a mother cuddling her baby or playful youngsters swinging from branch to branch. They eat a diet of lichens (a kind of mossy plant), along with leaves, flowers, and fruits.</p>

        <p>The <b>Golden Snub-Nosed Monkey</b> is very social, living in groups of up to 600 members. They communicate using a variety of sounds, from loud calls to softer chatter, and even facial expressions. In the cold winters, they grow extra thick fur to stay cozy, and in the summer, they shed it to stay cool.</p>

        <p>Sadly, deforestation and climate change threaten their homes, leaving them with fewer places to live. Conservationists are working hard to save their forests and protect them from harm. If we all pitch in, these magical monkeys might swing through the treetops for many years to come!</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Golden Snub-Nosed Monkey’s golden fur makes it look like it belongs in a fairy tale! These monkeys huddle together in large groups, sometimes as many as 600 members, to keep warm in their chilly mountain homes.</p>

        <div class="taxonomy">Panthera tigris amoyensis</div>
        <img src="../china/china animal img/south china tiger.JPG" >
        <p>The <b>South China Tiger</b>, or the "Amoy Tiger," is a real-life superhero in the animal kingdom. These tigers once roamed the forests of southern China, blending perfectly into the golden grasses and shady trees with their bold orange coats and dark stripes. They are smaller and stockier than their tiger cousins, but don’t let their size fool you—they are fierce hunters!</p>

        <p>These majestic cats use their sharp claws, strong jaws, and incredible stealth to hunt prey like deer and wild boar. They are masters of camouflage, creeping silently through the undergrowth until it’s time to pounce! Unfortunately, due to habitat loss and hunting, these tigers no longer roam freely in the wild. Instead, they live in captivity, where scientists work hard to breed and reintroduce them to their natural homes.</p>

        <p>By supporting conservation efforts, we can help ensure that these beautiful tigers once again rule the forests.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The South China Tiger is a sneaky, stealthy hunter with camouflage skills! It’s not the biggest tiger, but its sharp claws and quiet movements make it a fearsome predator in the forests of southern China.</p>

        <div class="taxonomy">Acipenser sinensis</div>
        <img src="../china/china animal img/chinese sturgeon.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Chinese Sturgeon</b> is like something straight out of the age of dinosaurs. It’s one of the oldest fish in the world, swimming in Earth’s rivers for over 140 million years! This ancient fish lives in China’s mighty Yangtze River and is famous for its incredible journeys. Every year, it swims from the ocean all the way back to freshwater rivers to lay its eggs—a trip that can be thousands of kilometers long!</p>

        <p>With its long, torpedo-shaped body and tough armor-like scales, the Chinese Sturgeon is built for survival. Unfortunately, pollution, dam construction, and habitat loss have made its life much harder. Scientists and conservationists are working to save this "living fossil" through breeding programs and cleaner river projects.</p>

        <img src="../china/china animal img/Asian Elephant.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Asian Elephant</b> is a true gentle giant of the animal kingdom. Found in the forests and grasslands of Asia, these elephants are smaller than their African cousins but just as impressive. With their big, floppy ears, long trunks, and incredible strength, they are nature’s construction workers. They can knock down trees and dig water holes with their trunks and tusks—an essential part of their environment!</p>

        <p>Asian Elephants live in close-knit herds, led by a wise female called a matriarch. A single elephant can munch through hundreds of pounds of grass, fruits, and bark in a day. These elephants also show affection by wrapping their trunks around one another.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, poaching and habitat loss have made life difficult for them. Luckily, conservationists are stepping up to protect them and help ensure their future.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Asian Elephant is a gentle giant that loves its family! These amazing elephants live in close-knit groups led by a wise female matriarch, who makes important decisions for the herd.</p>
