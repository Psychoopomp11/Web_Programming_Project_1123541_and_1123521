        <div class="taxonomy">Andrias davidianus</div>
        <img src="../china/china animal img/Chinese Giant Salamanders.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Chinese Giant Salamander</b> is so big it could be mistaken for a dragon! Growing up to 1.8 meters (5.9 feet) long, it’s the largest amphibian in the world. These incredible creatures live in the cold, fast-flowing rivers and streams of China, where they hide under rocks and swim silently through the water.</p>
        <p>Known for their wrinkled, dark grayish-brown skin, these salamanders are masters of survival. They can live for over 50 years and are incredible hunters, feeding on fish, insects, and even smaller salamanders. Unfortunately, their numbers are decreasing due to overhunting, pollution, and habitat loss. Conservation programs are working hard to protect the Chinese Giant Salamander, but it needs our help.</p>
        <p>If you love mythical creatures, the <b>Chinese Giant Salamander</b> is as close to a real-life dragon as it gets!</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Chinese Giant Salamander can grow up to 1.8 meters long and is the largest amphibian in the world—talk about a giant in the water!</p>

        <!--  Black Crested Gibbon -->
        <h2>6.  Black Crested Gibbon </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Nomascus concolor</div>
        <img src="../china/china animal img/Black Crested Gibbon.jpeg" >
        <p>The <b>Black Crested Gibbon</b> is a truly special primate found in the lush forests of Southeast Asia. Known for its striking black fur and the white "cape" around its shoulders, this monkey might look like it stepped out of a jungle legend. But the Black Crested Gibbon is more than just a beautiful creature—it’s also a master acrobat. With its long, strong arms, this gibbon can swing through the treetops at incredible speeds, traveling distances of up to 15 meters (about 50 feet) in a single leap! This agile creature spends most of its life high in the trees, using its powerful limbs to travel through the dense forest canopy, hunting for fruits, leaves, and insects. One of the most remarkable features of the Black Crested Gibbon is its haunting, melodic song. These songs echo through the forest at dawn and dusk, helping the gibbons communicate with each other and mark their territories.</p>
        <p>However, despite its impressive abilities and beauty, the Black Crested Gibbon is in danger of extinction. Deforestation, illegal hunting, and the loss of its natural habitat have all contributed to a sharp decline in its population. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this amazing primate, but much more needs to be done. Without immediate action, these incredible creatures could disappear from the wild.</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Black Crested Gibbon is a true jungle acrobat. It can swing up to 15 meters (49 feet) with just one leap, almost as if it’s flying through the trees!</p>

        <!-- Wild Bactrian Camel -->
        <h2>7. Wild Bactrian Camel </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Camelus ferus</div>
        <img src="../china/china animal img/Wild Bactrian Camel.JPG" >
        <p>The <b>Wild Bactrian Camel</b> is one of the toughest animals in the world, living in the deserts of China and Mongolia. This remarkable camel has long, shaggy hair and two distinct humps that are perfectly adapted to life in the extreme desert climate. The Wild Bactrian Camel is built for survival in conditions where most other animals would struggle. It can go without drinking fresh water for days, weeks, or even longer, relying on salty water from lakes and moisture from the plants it eats. This camel has a high tolerance for salt, which allows it to thrive in areas where other animals would dehydrate. Unlike domesticated camels, which can be found across the world, the Wild Bactrian Camel is a wild creature, living in the most remote, harshest parts of the desert.</p>
        <p>Sadly, these extraordinary animals are facing serious threats. Their habitat is disappearing due to human activity, including overgrazing by livestock and climate change. The Wild Bactrian Camel is now critically endangered, with only a small population remaining in the wild. Conservationists are working to protect these desert survivors, but much work remains to be done to ensure they do not vanish forever.</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Did you know the Wild Bactrian Camel can survive without drinking fresh water? It gets all the moisture it needs from salty lakes and desert plants!</p>
